# Gasless

Receive any token without any gas and keep rolling.

Somebody wants to send you crypto, you have a wallet but no native gas to move them forward so those first tokens are destined to be trapped there...

1. Go to [gasless](https://gassless-opal.vercel.app)
2. Go to deposit, connect the wallet in which you want your tokens
3. Copy the generated address and share that instead of your wallet
4. Once the payment is made, go to withdraw, select the token and the amount you want to receive in gas
5. Done! You now have your token + gas own them. 

The generated address is fixed to your wallet so you can avoid first steps for next time and just keep sending to this generated wallet each time you need.

Also YOU and only YOU own this wallet, any time you want you can avoid the website and go straight to the contract to withdraw your tokens, even from the explorer, only catch is you'll need gas. Gassless is a relayer that still needs your signature to execute transactions and the forwarder forward address is fixed so tokens can only go your way.
